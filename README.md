`apnotes.cls` is a LaTeX class derived from memoir. To use it, put 

```latex
\documentclass{apnotes}
```

at the beginning of your document.

Similarly, `apbeamer.cls` is a theme for creating presentations with 
the `beamer` LaTeX package. Usage:

```latex
\documentclass{apbeamer}
```

- My [dissertation](https://github.com/adarshp/dissertation), in which I use the
 `memoir` package to set the layout.
- My [CV](https://github.com/adarshp/Curriculum-Vitae), in which I use
    `memoir`'s `ctabular` environment to keep things nicely aligned.
